# CreditCardValidation

A Java program that validates credit card numbers using the Luhn algorithm. If a valid credit card number is provided, the program returns a random PIN.

## What I Learned
- Incoroporated Luhn algorithm to successfully validate credit card.The algorithm involves various steps, such as doubling certain digits, summing the digits, and checking for divisibility by 10. 
- I learned string manipulation techniques
   - reversing a string character by character was a key aspect of the algorithm.
 - Implemented the Random class to issue a random PIN
